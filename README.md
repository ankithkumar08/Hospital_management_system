# 🏥 Hospital Management System – SQL Project

## 📋 Overview

This **Hospital Management System** project simulates a real-world healthcare database designed using SQL. It integrates key hospital operations such as **patient registration**, **doctor management**, **appointments**, **treatments**, and **billing**. The database is structured to enable meaningful data analysis and reporting that can help administrators optimize hospital performance and improve patient care.
